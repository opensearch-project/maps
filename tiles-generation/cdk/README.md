# Tiles generation pipeline with CDK

 The tiles generation stack builds a raster map tiles generation pipeline on [Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) using [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/). The docker base image used in ECS comes from the [openstreetmap-tile-server](https://github.com/Overv/openstreetmap-tile-server) project.

Step1: Deploy CDK stack, prepare AWS resources, it will:
* Build and upload docker image to ECR
* Create ECS autoscaling provider and initialized with 0 EC2 instance
* Create ECS task definition

Step2: Execute ECS tiles task by run-task command, it will:
* Request new EC2 instance and volume created from autoscaling provider
* Start running task work
* Tiles images set with version controlled name will be uploaded to S3 bucket
* Once task finished, EC2 instance and volumes will be destroyed by autoscaling provider 

## Prerequisites
### Install Node.js
Visit [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install Node.js

### Install AWS CDK Toolkit
```
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

### Install AWS CLI
Visit [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) to install AWS CLI
### AWS Prerequisites
Visit [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_prerequisites) to configure aws credentials
## Deployment

### Deploy steps

1. (Optional)The tiles generation configuration could be customized at `cdk.ts`. For example, Users can customize tiles generation area, zoom level, schedule generation, etc.


2. A S3 bucket is required in CDK deployment to store generated tiles. The context name `TILE_S3_BUCKET` you will use to deploy. This bucket must be in the same aws account.

3. Deploy CDK stacks, all AWS resources defined within the scope of a stack.

* Test tile generation stack, it's used to test with light data for development and tuning performance. Since planet tiles generation task will take days, when you want to update the code source, it's recommended to test first with the tile generation test stack.
```
cdk deploy TestTileGenerationStack --context TILE_S3_BUCKET=S3BucketName
```

* Planet tile generation stack, currently we are using OSM planet data from [OpenStreetMap on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/osm/), the ECS task will download the latest version PBF file from there.
```
cdk deploy PlanetTileGenerationStack --context TILE_S3_BUCKET=S3BucketName
```

4. Execute tiles generation. Once stack deployed, note the `ClusterName`, `TaskDefinitionArn`, `CapacityProviderName` from the output of the command. Use them on the below command.

```
aws ecs run-task --cluster ClusterName --task-definition TaskDefinitionArn --capacity-provider-strategy capacityProvider=CapacityProviderName
```

5. Check result. On AWS management console, you can check ECS task logs, after ECS test task exited with 0, the maps tiles will be uploaded to S3 bucket.

## Useful commands

 * `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
 * `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk destroy`     destroy the stack
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
